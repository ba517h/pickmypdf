# Phase 3.4.1 Report: Server and Port Management During Development

**Project**: PickMyPDF - AI-Powered Travel Itinerary Platform  
**Phase**: 3.4.1 - Server and Port Management  
**Date**: December 27, 2024  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED & TESTED  

## Executive Summary

Phase 3.4.1 documents the process and best practices for managing the development server and port usage, specifically focusing on handling issues with port 3000 (the default for Next.js). This ensures a smooth developer experience and prevents conflicts that can arise from orphaned or stuck processes during rapid development cycles.

## Key Actions and Learnings

### 1. Identifying and Killing Processes on Port 3000
- **Command Used:**
  ```sh
  lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 || true
  ```
- **Purpose:** Frees up port 3000 by forcefully terminating any process using it, preventing 'address already in use' errors when starting the Next.js server.
- **Best Practice:** Always check and clear port 3000 before starting a new server instance, especially after abrupt terminations or crashes.

### 2. Restarting the Development Server
- **Command Used:**
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
- **Purpose:** Starts the Next.js development server, which by default listens on port 3000.
- **Outcome:** Ensures the application is accessible at http://localhost:3000 and hot-reloads on code changes.

### 3. Verifying Server Status
- **Indicators of Success:**
  - Terminal output shows 'Ready' and 'Compiled' messages
  - No errors about port conflicts
  - Application loads successfully in the browser

### 4. Handling Detached HEAD and Branch Management
- **Best Practice:**
  - Always ensure you are on the correct git branch (usually `main`) before starting development work.
  - Use `git checkout main` to return to the main branch if in a detached HEAD state.

## Troubleshooting Checklist
- [x] Kill any process on port 3000 before running the dev server
- [x] Confirm server starts without port conflict errors
- [x] Ensure you are on the correct git branch
- [x] Validate application loads at http://localhost:3000

## Recommendations
- **Automate port checks** in development scripts for a smoother workflow
- **Document these steps** in the project README for all contributors
- **Monitor for orphaned processes** after forced server stops or crashes

## Conclusion

Phase 3.4.1 establishes a reliable workflow for managing the development server and port usage, reducing downtime and confusion during development. These practices ensure that the team can quickly resolve port conflicts and maintain productivity.
